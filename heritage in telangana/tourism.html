    <p  style="width:80%"><h4>TA city of contrasts, Hyderabad exudes an old-world charm of its own with the Old City (Charminar side), 
      Hitech City (Cyberabad) and the other areas lying between the old and the new. The capital and the largest 
      city of Telanaga, Hyderabad is home to stately mosques and noisy bazaars lined parallelly alongside swanky 
      new office buildings and malls, and it is these very contrasts – these glimpses into the city’s rich past with 
      inherent promises of an even better future –that make Hyderabad a city worth visiting.</h4></p>

      closer and closer to the visitor, the width of the mighty Godavari becomes narrower. it was initially named as 'Papidi' Kondalu- Paidi in 
      Telugu means the middle partition of a woman’s hair. The river narrowing, its twists and turns along with the Papi Hills form a breathtaking visual experience.</h4></p>
