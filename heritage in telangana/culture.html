<hr style="width: 80%">
<p align=center>Telangana, also spelled Telengana or Telingana, constituent state of south-central India. It is bordered by the states of Maharashtra to the north, Chhattisgarh and Odisha to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the southeast and south, and Karnataka to the west. The area of what is now Telangana constituted the north-central and northeastern portions of Andhra Pradesh for almost six decades, but on <b>June 2, 2014,</b> that territory was calved off to form a separate state. The capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh is Hyderabad, in west-central Telangana.
<br><b>Telangana lies at a crossroads between northern and southern India, and it has a diverse population. In general, the state’s various communities are identified more readily by a combination of language, religion, and social class or caste than they are by specific ethnic affiliation. </b>The Dravidian language Telugu is the official and most widely spoken language in the state. A small minority speaks Urdu, a language primarily of northern India and Pakistan. Most of the remaining groups speak border-area languages, including Hindi, Kannada, and Marathi. Lambadi (Banjari) and other languages are spoken by the state’s Scheduled Tribes (the official designation for indigenous minority peoples). The great majority of Telangana’s residents practice Hinduism, while smaller numbers of the population follow Islam. Some one-fourth of the state’s people are members of Scheduled Castes (the official designation for those formerly called “untouchables”) and Scheduled Tribes.<br><b>The cultural hearts of Telangana, Hyderabad and Warangal, are noted for their wealth and renowned historical structures – Charminar, Qutb Shahi Tombs, Paigah Tombs, Falaknuma Palace, Chowmahalla Palace, Warangal Fort, Kakatiya Kala Thoranam, Thousand Pillar Temple and the Bhongir Fort in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district.</b> The historic city Golconda in Hyderabad established itself as a diamond trading centre and, until the end of the 19th century, the Golconda market was the primary source of the finest and largest diamonds in the world. Thus, the legendary name Golconda Diamonds became synonymous with Golconda itself. The Golconda region has produced some of the world's most famous diamonds, including the colourless Koh-i-Noor (United Kingdom), the blue Hope (United States), the pink Daria-i-Noor (Iran), the white Regent (France), the Dresden Green (Germany), and the colourless Orlov (Russia), Nizam and Jacob (India), as well as the now lost diamonds Florentine Yellow, Akbar Shah and Great Mogul. Religious edifices like the Lakshmi Narasimha Temple in Yadadri Bhuvanagiri district, Makkah Masjid in Hyderabad, and Medak Cathedral are several of its most famous places of worship.
