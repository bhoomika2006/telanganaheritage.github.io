        Golichina directly translates to fry in Telugu. Since the dishes in Telangana are known for their spices, 
        this dish is one of the dishes that are rich in spices. The dish is basically succulent pieces of mutton 
        that are immersed into a really thick gravy. It can be eaten with rice and rotis.

      <h5 class="w3-center">Really Unique </h5>
      <p class="w3-large">
        This is basically an alternative for rasam and requires much less work in order to be cooked. Generally, 
        for rasam we have to wait till the tamarind has been boiled and then it is ready for use but in case of 
        making pachi pulusu you have to only soak the tamarind in the lukewarm water and it is good for use. Though 
        the dish is very easy to prepare and doesnâ€™t require much attention, its taste is really unique and it is famous 
        all over the state of Telangana.
